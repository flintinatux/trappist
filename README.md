# trappist

A Löve2D game made for the [Weekend Crazy Jam](https://itch.io/jam/weekend-crazy-jam) celebrating the discovery of *Seven Earth-size Exoplanets*!

## How to play

First install [Löve2D](https://love2d.org/), and then download and double-click on `trappist.love`.  The game starts immediately.

You play as the captain of the Trappist Defense Network, and the Enemy is constantly sending bombers to destroy all seven of your planets.  Your only defensive weapon is the network of interplanetary lasers installed throughout the system.

Click with your mouse to fire the lasers and defend the honor of the Trappist Star System!
